## Why I need to step back ?
It's been a month I subscribe to the KubeCraft Career Accelerator program. I realise how I was lost in the Linux basics utilisation and commands. I use to develop on Linux embedded system, but I used only 10 % of the real capacity of the linux CLI.  

So, I decided to become a beginner again to master the linux CLI first, and use full development process only in CLI on a terminal. This way I can become a beast on the fondamentals, and in few months, I will be able to learn any thing with just a terminal, or manage and administrate any linux server around the world with just a basic terminal and `bash`.

## What I curently learn
1. Use 100 % the keyboard with the typing method
2. Use `tmux` as a terminal multiplexor
3. Use `vim` as text editor
4. Use `MacOs X shortcuts` to navigate between my desks

## Basics workflow

I decided to become a full keyboard developer with the minimum mouse usage in my workflow. 
Also, because I decided to use the right typing method, I actualy typing like my grand-mother, but it's a trad of time right now to become more productif in the future. 

## My note taking system

I also use a note taking system to track my progress and set to myself vision and goals. This way I have no excuses to spend time in untertainment or in a wrong rabbit hole. 

I use Obsidian with the `vim` keys binding to develop my habit using this tool as long as it's possible for me. 

### Daily note

Each day I have template create for mi the daily routine I build for the week. With this method I can have nice to do list of the day and log my day here to track if any thing particular happend. 

### Weekly note 

This way eatch weekend I can have a review of my progress and track is I am on the right trick or if I need to become werred about my tasks who is not done. I also add specific tasks for the weekly note to do like clean my email box, set my next weekly goals.

### Monthly note

One time per month I review where I am in my goals and make a deeper analysis of my statut progress and personnal feeling. I also need to set the goals of the next month and make the to do list.

### Anualy note

This note isn't about review all the monthly note but to setup the vision of the year. It's more like the main quests, the stat where you want to be. This is the first step, set the desire stat I want, and then I used all the previews types of note with the same question : How can I reach this vision, stat ? 

### How to set a goal ?

On my monthly, weekly, and daily notes I set goals with the method SMART :
1. `S` : Specific. What will be accomplished ? What action will you take ?
2. `M` : Mesurable. What data will mesure the goal ? How much? How well?
3. `A` : Achivable. Is the goal doable? Do you have the necessary skills and ressources? 
4. `R` : Relevante. How does the goal align with you broader goals? Why is the result important?
5. `T` : Time-bound. What is the time frame for accomplishing the goal?

### Results

In two months, I feel like I learn more then the 10 previews months. I feel very confident and become more and more productive eatch day. The vision set up is really powerfull, because even you can feel discourageous, you know you are on the right path and just do the work. I don't know why this process isn't teach in school, because it's a very powerfull tool.

## Conclusion

With my new workflow, note taking system, I am confident I will reach my desire stat in no time. However, the danjeur here is the burnout, or the lack of discipline who can completly stop the machine and break all the work done. I am very aware of this danger, so I make some whatchdogs in place to be relax, manage my stress, and don't over book myself.
