## **Why I needed to step back**

It’s been a month since I subscribed to the KubeCraft Career Accelerator program. I quickly realized how lost I was when it came to Linux basics, especially everyday usage and command-line fundamentals. I used to develop on embedded Linux systems, but I was probably using only 10% of the real power of the Linux CLI.

So I decided to become a beginner again and truly master the Linux command line first, using the full development process directly in the terminal. The goal is to become extremely strong on the fundamentals so that, in a few months, I’ll be able to learn anything using only a terminal, and manage or administer any Linux server anywhere in the world with just a basic shell and bash.
  

## **What I am currently learning**

1. Using 100% of the keyboard with proper touch typing
    
2. Using tmux as a terminal multiplexer
    
3. Using vim as a text editor
    
4. Using macOS shortcuts to navigate between desktops
    

## **Basic workflow**

I decided to become a keyboard-first developer, with minimal mouse usage in my workflow.

At the same time, because I chose to learn proper touch typing, I am currently typing like my grandmother. It feels like a waste of time right now, but it’s an investment to become much more productive in the future.

## **My note-taking system**

I also use a note-taking system to track my progress and define my vision and goals. This helps me avoid excuses, unnecessary entertainment, or falling into the wrong rabbit holes.

I use Obsidian with vim key bindings to build strong habits and stay consistent with this tool as much as possible.

### **Daily notes**

### **Weekly notes**

Every weekend, I review my progress and check whether I’m on the right track or if I should be concerned about unfinished tasks. I also add specific weekly tasks such as cleaning my email inbox and setting goals for the next week.

### **Monthly notes**

Once a month, I review where I stand with my goals and perform a deeper analysis of my progress and personal feelings. I also define the goals for the next month and create a dedicated to-do list.

### **Yearly note**

This note is not about reviewing all the monthly notes, but about defining the vision for the year. It’s more about the main quests—the state I want to reach. This is the first step: defining the desired state, then using all the previous types of notes to answer one recurring question:

How can I reach this vision and this state?

### **How I set goals**

In my monthly, weekly, and daily notes, I use the SMART method:

1. **S – Specific**: What will be accomplished? What action will be taken?
    
2. **M – Measurable**: What data will measure the goal? How much? How well?
    
3. **A – Achievable**: Is the goal doable? Do I have the necessary skills and resources?
    
4. **R – Relevant**: How does the goal align with broader objectives? Why is the result important?
    
5. **T – Time-bound**: What is the timeframe for accomplishing the goal?
    
### **Results**

In two months, I feel like I’ve learned more than in the previous ten months combined. I feel much more confident and increasingly productive every day. Having a clear vision is extremely powerful: even when motivation drops, I know I’m on the right path and just need to do the work.
  
I honestly don’t know why this process isn’t taught in school, because it’s an incredibly powerful tool.

## **Conclusion**

With my new workflow and note-taking system, I’m confident I will reach my desired state over time. The real danger, however, is burnout or a lack of discipline, which could completely stop the momentum and undo the progress made.

I’m very aware of this risk, so I’ve put some safeguards in place to relax, manage stress, and avoid overloading myself.
